# Ollama Model Downloader

A simple Python script to download multiple Ollama models sequentially.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Ollama installed and working on your system ([Install Ollama](https://ollama.ai))

## Installation

1. Download the `ollamaDownloader.py` script
4. Ensure you have Ollama installed and working (`ollama --version` should work in your terminal)

## Usage

Run this command in the terminal/powershell with a comma-separated list of model names:

```bash
python ollamaDownloader.py "model1,model2,model3"
```

Example:
```bash
python ollamaDownloader.py "phi3:14b-medium-128k-instruct-q5_0,qwen2.5-coder:14b-instruct-q4_0"
```

The script will:
1. Download each model sequentially
2. Show download progress in real-time
3. Wait 5 seconds between downloads
4. Report success or failure for each model
